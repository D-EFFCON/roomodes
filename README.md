4. **Security Module** - Ensures proper handling of sensitive information
5. **File Manager** - Provides safe and reliable file system operations for configurations

### MCP Configuration Files

The MCP Wizard manages two main configuration files:

1. **MCP Configuration File** (`.roo/mcp.json`): Contains server configurations, including command, arguments, and permission scopes.

2. **Roomodes File** (`.roomodes`): Contains roomode definitions for MCP servers, enabling AI assistants to interact with the servers.

Example MCP configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
        "--access-token",
        "${env:SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      ],
      "alwaysAllow": [
        "list_tables",
        "execute_sql"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP.json file follows this schema:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "[server-id]": {
      "command": "string",
      "args": ["string"],
      "alwaysAllow": ["string"],
      "env": {
        "ENV_VAR": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

MCP integration roomodes follow this structure:

```json
{
  "slug": "mcp-[server-id]",
  "name": "Server Name Integration",
  "model": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
  "roleDefinition": "You are a specialized assistant...",

- Required and optional arguments
- Recommended permissions
- Example configurations
- Roomode templates

For testing purposes, a mock implementation of the Registry Client is available, which simulates all Registry API endpoints without requiring an actual registry server.

### MCP Integration Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Add `.roo/mcp.json` to version control but exclude any files containing actual secrets.

2. **Environment Variables**: Use a `.env` file for local development (added to `.gitignore`) and proper environment variable management for production.

3. **Regular Updates**: Periodically check for updates to MCP servers and update your configurations.

4. **Permission Auditing**: Regularly review the permissions granted to each server and remove any that are no longer needed.

5. **Documentation**: Document the MCP servers used in your project and their configuration requirements for team members.

6. **Secure Storage of Environment Variables**:
   - For development: Use `.env` files (but don't commit them to version control)
   - For production: Use a secrets management solution (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

7. **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Grant only the permissions that are necessary

8. **Use specific package versions**: Avoid using "latest" to prevent supply chain attacks

## SPARC Files and Implementation

When you run `npx create-sparc init` without a project name, it creates two essential SPARC files:

### .roo Directory

The `.roo` directory contains configuration files, rules, and templates that define how the SPARC methodology is applied to your project. It includes:

- Rules for code generation
- Templates for components and other project elements
- Configuration for SPARC modes
- Guidelines for development practices
- MCP configuration (mcp.json)

### .roomodes File

The `.roomodes` file defines the different modes that can be used with the SPARC methodology in your project. These modes help structure the development process according to the SPARC phases (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion).

These files are essential for using the SPARC methodology in your project and provide the foundation for structured, efficient development.

## Implementation Instructions

### Installation & Activation

1. **Initialize SPARC in your project**: Run `npx create-sparc init` in your project directory to set up the necessary SPARC files.
2. **Activate SPARC Orchestrator**: In Roo Code, select the "SPARC Orchestrator" as your primary mode to begin the development process.

### Task Delegation

1. **Use Boomerang Tasks**: Delegate tasks to specialized modes (Specification & Pseudocode, Architect, Code, TDD, etc.) using the Boomerang task concept with clear instructions.
2. **Context Isolation**: Each subtask runs in its own isolated context and returns a concise summary upon completion.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Modes like TDD, Debug, and Security Reviewer iterate until all tests pass, files remain modular (<500 lines), and no environment variables are hard-coded.

### Final Integration & Monitoring

1. **Integration**: The Integrator mode consolidates outputs from all specialized modes into a final, cohesive deliverable.
2. **Documentation & Monitoring**: The Documentation Writer mode produces detailed guides, while the Post-Deployment Monitor tracks live performance and flags issues.
3. **Continuous Optimization**: The Optimizer mode ensures ongoing improvements and adherence to best practices.

### Customization Options

1. **Tool Access Restrictions**: Adjust the access permissions for each mode to control which tools they can use.
2. **Role Definitions**: Edit the role definitions to match your organization's language and standards.
3. **Project-Specific Overrides**: The `.roomodes` file in your project root can override global settings for your specific project needs.

## Quick Start Example

Here's a quick example of how to use SPARC methodology with Roo Code for a new project:

1. **Initialize a new SPARC project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-sparc-project
   cd my-sparc-project
   npx create-sparc init
   ```

2. **Open the project in VS Code with Roo Code extension installed**

3. **Start with the SPARC Orchestrator mode**:
   - Select the "‚ö°Ô∏è SPARC Orchestrator" mode in Roo Code
   - Describe your project goal: "I want to create a REST API for a todo list application"

4. **Follow the guided workflow**:
   - The Orchestrator will break down your project into phases
   - Each phase will be handled by a specialized mode
   - You'll receive clear instructions at each step

5. **Review and integrate the results**:
   - The final code will be modular, secure, and well-tested
   - Documentation will be comprehensive and up-to-date
   - The architecture will follow best practices

This workflow dramatically reduces development time while ensuring high-quality, maintainable code.
