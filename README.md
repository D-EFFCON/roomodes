The SPARC methodology (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) breaks down complex development tasks into manageable phases, each handled by specialized AI assistants. This approach ensures:

- **Structured Development**: Clear progression through well-defined phases
- **Modular Architecture**: Code naturally organized into maintainable components
- **Security by Design**: No hard-coded secrets, proper configuration management
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in test-driven development practices
- **Thorough Documentation**: Automatically generated, always up-to-date

## Prerequisites

### Roo Code VS Code Extension

To fully leverage the SPARC methodology, you'll need the Roo Code extension for Visual Studio Code. This powerful extension provides:

- **AI-powered coding assistance** with specialized modes for different development phases
- **Context-aware interactions** that understand your project structure
- **Integrated task management** with the Boomerang task concept
- **Seamless file operations** directly within your editor

You can install the Roo Code extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline).



## Usage

### Create a new project

You can create a new project in two ways:

```bash
# Create a full project with a specific name
npx create-sparc init my-project

# Create only .roo and .roomodes files in the current directory
npx create-sparc init
```

You can also use the shorthand version:

```bash
npx create-sparc my-project
```

Options:
- `--template <name>` - Template to use (default: "default")
- `--skip-install` - Skip dependency installation
- `--use-npm` - Use npm as package manager
- `--use-yarn` - Use yarn as package manager
- `--use-pnpm` - Use pnpm as package manager
- `--no-git` - Skip git initialization
- `--typescript` - Use TypeScript
- `--no-symlink` - Disable symlink creation

### Initialize SPARC files in an existing project

If you want to add SPARC methodology to an existing project, you can run:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-existing-project

# Initialize SPARC files (.roo and .roomodes) without creating project structure
npx create-sparc init
```

This will only create the necessary SPARC files in your current directory without modifying your existing project structure.

### Add a component to an existing project

```bash
npx create-sparc add component --name MyComponent
```

Options:
- `--name <name>` - Component name
- `--type <type>` - Component type (default: "component")
- `--path <path>` - Custom path for component

## SPARC Methodology

SPARC stands for:

- **S**pecification
- **P**seudocode
- **A**rchitecture
- **R**efinement
- **C**ompletion

This methodology provides a structured approach to software development, ensuring high-quality, maintainable code. SPARC enables you to deconstruct large, intricate projects into manageable subtasks, each delegated to a specialized mode.

### SPARC with Roo Code Integration

The SPARC methodology is fully integrated with Roo Code through the Boomerang task concept. This integration empowers you to build complex, production-ready, secure, and scalable applications by leveraging specialized AI assistants for different phases of development.

By using advanced reasoning models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek for analytical tasks, alongside instructive models for coding, DevOps, testing, and implementation, you create a robust, automated, and secure workflow.

### SPARC Modes

When you initialize a project with `npx create-sparc init`, the following specialized modes become available in your Roo Code environment:

- **‚ö°Ô∏è SPARC Orchestrator**: Breaks down large objectives into delegated subtasks aligned to the SPARC methodology
- **üìã Specification Writer**: Captures full project context and translates it into modular pseudocode with TDD anchors
- **üèóÔ∏è Architect**: Designs scalable, secure, and modular architectures based on requirements
- **üß† Auto-Coder**: Writes clean, efficient, modular code based on pseudocode and architecture
- **üß™ Tester (TDD)**: Implements Test-Driven Development by writing tests first and refactoring after minimal implementation
- **ü™≤ Debugger**: Troubleshoots runtime bugs, logic errors, or integration failures
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security Reviewer**: Performs static and dynamic audits to ensure secure code practices
- **üìö Documentation Writer**: Writes concise, clear, and modular Markdown documentation
- **üîó System Integrator**: Merges the outputs of all modes into a working, tested, production-ready system
- **üìà Deployment Monitor**: Observes the system post-launch, collecting performance, logs, and user feedback
- **üßπ Optimizer**: Refactors, modularizes, and improves system performance
- **‚ùì Ask**: Guides users in formulating precise, modular requests to delegate tasks
- **üöÄ DevOps**: Manages deployments and infrastructure operations across cloud providers
- **üìò SPARC Tutorial**: Guides new users through the SPARC development process
- **üîê Supabase Admin**: Designs and implements database schemas, RLS policies, triggers, and functions for Supabase projects
- **‚ôæÔ∏è MCP Integration**: Connects to and manages external services through MCP interfaces

Each mode operates within its own isolated context, ensuring focused and efficient task management while adhering to best practices‚Äîavoiding hard-coded environment variables, maintaining files under 500 lines, and ensuring a modular, extensible design.

## SPARC Files and Implementation

When you run `npx create-sparc init` without a project name, it creates two essential SPARC files:

### .roo Directory

The `.roo` directory contains configuration files, rules, and templates that define how the SPARC methodology is applied to your project. It includes:

- Rules for code generation
- Templates for components and other project elements
- Configuration for SPARC modes
- Guidelines for development practices

### .roomodes File

The `.roomodes` file defines the different modes that can be used with the SPARC methodology in your project. These modes help structure the development process according to the SPARC phases (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion).

These files are essential for using the SPARC methodology in your project and provide the foundation for structured, efficient development.

## Implementation Instructions

### Installation & Activation

1. **Initialize SPARC in your project**: Run `npx create-sparc init` in your project directory to set up the necessary SPARC files.
2. **Activate SPARC Orchestrator**: In Roo Code, select the "SPARC Orchestrator" as your primary mode to begin the development process.

### Task Delegation

1. **Use Boomerang Tasks**: Delegate tasks to specialized modes (Specification & Pseudocode, Architect, Code, TDD, etc.) using the Boomerang task concept with clear instructions.
2. **Context Isolation**: Each subtask runs in its own isolated context and returns a concise summary upon completion.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Modes like TDD, Debug, and Security Reviewer iterate until all tests pass, files remain modular (<500 lines), and no environment variables are hard-coded.

### Final Integration & Monitoring

1. **Integration**: The Integrator mode consolidates outputs from all specialized modes into a final, cohesive deliverable.
2. **Documentation & Monitoring**: The Documentation Writer mode produces detailed guides, while the Post-Deployment Monitor tracks live performance and flags issues.
3. **Continuous Optimization**: The Optimizer mode ensures ongoing improvements and adherence to best practices.

### Customization Options

1. **Tool Access Restrictions**: Adjust the access permissions for each mode to control which tools they can use.
2. **Role Definitions**: Edit the role definitions to match your organization's language and standards.
3. **Project-Specific Overrides**: The `.roomodes` file in your project root can override global settings for your specific project needs.

## Quick Start Example

Here's a quick example of how to use SPARC methodology with Roo Code for a new project:

1. **Initialize a new SPARC project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-sparc-project
   cd my-sparc-project
   npx create-sparc init
   ```

2. **Open the project in VS Code with Roo Code extension installed**

3. **Start with the SPARC Orchestrator mode**:
   - Select the "‚ö°Ô∏è SPARC Orchestrator" mode in Roo Code
   - Describe your project goal: "I want to create a REST API for a todo list application"

4. **Follow the guided workflow**:
   - The Orchestrator will break down your project into phases
   - Each phase will be handled by a specialized mode
   - You'll receive clear instructions at each step

5. **Review and integrate the results**:
   - The final code will be modular, secure, and well-tested
